I remember that when he heard a quickstep was planned, he decided to sit out the dance before to prepare himself…after all, he isn’t a young fellow anymore, you know. <i>I</i> don’t need any preparation to dance the quickstep; I could dance for hours without sitting, though I did of course sit out one dance to be polite. I had a private laugh about that when Lady Rose requested that the quickstep be delayed by a dance. I say, when Lord George realized that there was a dance between his break and the quickstep, he was quite irate. The old chap needn’t have worried though, as Lady Rose is none too spry either, and the quickstep was played almost sedately in my opinion.
