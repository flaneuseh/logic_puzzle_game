<p>The hours are ticking down until the tournament begins, so there is no time to waste. You get into your uncle’s car (it occurs to you that your aunt should have taken this car, which is much more reliable than hers) and start gathering your ingredients. First, a quick trip to Herb & Harvest to pick up the freshest Jalapenos they have. Slicing them in cubes you begin grilling them, before heading out Bayside Market. Luckily their tomatoes are as fresh and juicy as your aunt intended. The vegetables cook well with the chili powder you picked up from Greenfield Market. And as a final touch, locally sourced black beans from O'Reilly's farm.  The delicious smell that fills the kitchen reminds you what this is all about! </p> 


<p>You arrive to Maryport Square at 5:00 PM sharp with piping hot chili stored safely in the back seat. The competition is fierce, but you notice several people coming back to your stand for seconds. You definitely have upheld the Nielson legacy, despite the stress of the day! At 7:00 PM the results are announced. Your family has taken home the trophy for the 4th year in a row! </p> 

<p>On the car ride home, you get a phone call. It’s Aunt Susan, finally. </p> 

<p>“Hello dear, so sorry I couldn’t make it today! You wouldn’t believe the day I had. Listen, you remembered to add the cayenne right?” </p>
