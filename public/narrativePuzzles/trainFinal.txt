<p> When you return home you get a call from the service attendant, Katherine. </p> 

<p> “I just did a thorough cleaning of all the cars. I unfortunately did not find your briefcase, but I did notice a pen in car 2. I didn’t think much of it at first, but then I saw that it was from Riverside University. That is your university right? You almost certainly left it in your briefcase and it must have fell out when whoever stole it was rifling through your research. “ </p> 


<p> This is it, the last clue you needed to solve this mystery. From your investigation earlier you know that the thief must be Ethan Owen who got off at Seastead. You book the next train out to confront him. </p> 

<p> When you arrive at his house, he seems surprised to see you but invites you in. You immediately confront him about the briefcase. </p> 

<p>“Wait this was your briefcase? You don’t seem to be the type to be able to make discoveries like this…. no offense. You just don’t seem completely there, if you understand what I mean. </p> 

<p>But yes, fine. I was the one to take your briefcase. People don’t realize how hard it is to be the 3rd child in a family like mine. I won’t inherit the Owen title, like my oldest brother, and I certainly am not the genius that Henry is. Father keeps telling me to `do something with my life.’ Which isn’t fair at all, I have done plenty with my life. I play pool with the governor’s son!  But alas, father says I need to do something worthy of our house, and a discovery such as yours would surely outshine Henry. But you have me found out, so here it is. We can put this whole thing behind us, yes? “ </p>
