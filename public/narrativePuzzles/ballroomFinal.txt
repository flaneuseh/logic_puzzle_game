When you examine it more closely, you realize that the glass on the clock face is also slightly cracked, suggesting it was knocked over recently. The clock is also right next to the bust where the necklace was resting, so you realize it is likely that it was knocked over by the culprit. The maid and Lady Rose confirm that the clock was working at the time the dancing started, confirming your suspicions. The time on the broken clock is stuck at 7:35, during the fourth dance - the Quickstep.</p>

But really, Rose has had it these past twenty years, and it’s well past time I had a turn, don’t you think?” </p>
