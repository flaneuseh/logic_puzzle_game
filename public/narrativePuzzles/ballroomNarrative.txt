<p>The most anticipated event of the season is always Lady Rose Ellington’s Chrysanthemum Ball, and this year is no exception. You’ve spent weeks assembling the perfect outfit, practicing your social dances, and memorizing details about the illustrious attendees calculated to make the best impression. </p> 

<p>When you arrive at the party, it’s in an uproar with Lady Rose distraught over the loss of her precious diamond and ruby necklace. The necklace had been sitting in its customary place on a marble bust of Lady Rose’s grandmother, awaiting the time when she would ceremoniously don it to officially open the ball. Everyone agrees the necklace was present when someone suggested some informal dancing before the official start of the ball. No one can agree on who made the suggestion, but four guests were present at the time: Lady Eleanor Appleton, Lord George Elliot, Miss Clementine Baker, and Mr. John Parker. By the time the necklace was noticed missing, the group had danced four times. Between the 4 guests and Lady Rose there was an uneven number of people, so someone was obliged to sit out each dance. Lady Rose herself went to sit out the fifth dance, at which point she discovered the necklace missing. When you arrived, they appealed to you for your opinion as someone who couldn’t possibly have taken the necklace. As the pianist did not leave the piano, and the maid was in constant view from the foyer where the butler stood, you concluded that one of the guests must have stolen the necklace when they sat out for a dance. Unfortunately, there is not a clear record of who danced which dance, or what order they were in, but you were able to gather the following pieces of evidence to determine who must have stolen Lady Rose’s necklace. </p>

<p>Witness Statement from Lady Eleanor Appleton:</p> 

<p> I simply don’t see why I should have been obliged to sit out for a dance, when isn’t the function of one’s companion to preserve them from such indignities? Terribly presumptuous of the girl to swan boldly onto the dance floor like a person of consequence, when she wouldn’t have a scrap to her name without my generous patronage. And what uncultured dancing! It’s not surprising at all that she stepped on her own dress during her ungracious attempt at a waltz, and what an unbecoming shade of red she became! If I had so embarrassed myself in front of my betters, I would not have had the nerve to show myself again. Unfortunately, Clementine returned as soon as she had gotten Lady Rose’s maid to repair her wardrobe, only missing the next dance - disregarding the inconvenience to the rest of the party of not having a maid to attend our needs, I might add.</p>

<p>Witness Statement from Miss Alice Wright, pianist:</p> 
	<p>No, I’m sorry, I can’t tell you the order of the pieces; when I play I lose myself in the music and have no sense of time passing or the dance changing. What I can tell you is that I put the music for each dance on top of the previous score on my piano. I was just finishing the fourth dance when Lady Rose snatched its music score away, screaming that she couldn’t bear to hear music anymore as her necklace was missing. I saw that the melody underneath was a tango before Lady Rose swept it along with the rest of the music to the floor, putting everything hopelessly out of order.</p>

<p>Witness statement from Mr. John Parker: </p> 

<p>“I remember that when Lord George heard a quickstep was planned, he decided to sit out the dance before to prepare himself…after all, he isn’t a young fellow anymore, you know. I don’t need any preparation to dance the quickstep; I could dance for hours without sitting though I did of course sit out one dance to be polite. I had a private laugh about that when Lady Rose requested that the quickstep be delayed by a dance. I say, when Lord George realized that there was a dance between his break and the quickstep, he was quite irate. The old chap needn’t have worried though, as Lady Rose is none too spry either, and the quickstep was played almost sedately in my opinion. Hardly deserving of the name.”</p>

<p>Witness Statement from Lady Rose Ellington:</p> 
<p>“I don’t know why you’re asking me all these questions…[sniffs daintily into her lace handkerchief] I simply don’t know how I can be expected to remember things like who I danced with when my precious necklace is missing. Mr. Parker? Oh, he is such a polite and dashing young man! When we danced the quickstep I felt quite ten years younger! It did put me rather out of breath of course.”</p> 

<p>Witness Statement from Lady Eleanor Appleton:</p> 
<p>“Mr. Parker? That young man knows how to pay respect to his betters. A little too well, I think sometimes. [lowers her voice]Why, Rose was positively swooning for him earlier, and I simply don’t think it’s appropriate for a woman of her age to be dancing the tango with a man quite twenty years her junior.” </p>
